In 1828 it was luxuriously and elaborately refurbished with a magnificent mahogany bar and fittings which was unprecedented for a pub interior at that time and arguably set the look for the iconic Victorian pub. The fixtures and fittings of this bar have been stripped away over the years but the atmosphere lingers on. This is the charming bar inside the dilapidated Wilton's music Hall.

Check the website or at London ticket agencies. Whilst there's no formal dress code for attending a performance, dressing smartly is advised.

To get back to North Greenwich station, take bus route 472 or 161 - a ten-minute walk away. The 117 or 118 bus route will return you to Greenwich town centre.

The pergola offers two stunning views from its north-western point. You can look straight out and over the heath's canopy and see nothing but mature trees. Alternatively, you can look down and see the beautifully manicured herb garden and the length of the pergola stretching out before you. The adjacent Hill Garden offers a complete contrast to the wildness of the pergola. The garden is beautifully manicured and is a favourite haunt for artists.

The square has been associated with the many hundreds of pigeons that used to be found here, but in 2003 a bylaw was passed to make it illegal to feed them. Nelson's Column, surrounded by the four bronze lions can be found here, on the south side of the square. The north-west plinth in the square was intended to hold an equestrian statue of William IV, but remained bare since 1841 due to insufficient funds.

Nelson's Column, surrounded by the four bronze lions can be found here, on the south side of the square.

The bridge opens several times each day to permit ships to pass through \u2013 timings are dependent on demand, and are not regularly scheduled. When Tower Bridge was built, the area to the west of it was a bustling port \u2013 necessitating a bridge that could permit tall boats to pass. Now the South Bank area sits to its west, and the regenerated Butler's Wharf area of shops and riverside restaurants lie to its east. You can get the lift to the top level of the bridge and admire the view. Glass floors provide an interesting perspective for the brave. The museum highlights the bridge's history and engineering, and there are photographic exhibitions along the walkways between the towers.",
