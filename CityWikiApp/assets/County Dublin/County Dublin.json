    "about": "'''County Dublin''' (''Contae Bhaile \u00c1tha Cliath'') is a historic county surrounding Dublin city in the Republic of Ireland, with a population of 1.5 million in 2022. It was abolished as an administrative or political unit in 1994, with its territory allocated to four new entities. Nevertheless it still coheres as a destination for travellers, in two ways: for the city to escape to the surrounds, for instance to the seaside at Howth or the races at Leopardstown; and for visitors to stay here and day-trip into Dublin while avoiding the city's congestion and high prices.",

      "description": "Belfield House was the original estate purchased by UCD in the 1930s. It was built in 1801 by Ambrose Moore. Inside the porch (visible even if the house is locked) is one of the finest examples of Irish neoclassical sculpture called Hibernia, with the Bust of Lord Cloncurry. The sculpture was made by artist John Hogan in 1841 when he was working in Rome. The sculpture arrived in Ireland in 1846 to be exhibited at the Royal Exchange, which is now City Hall. The sculpture was in Lyons Estate and acquired by UCD when it purchased the estate in 1963. A large bay window (facing the running track) looks out onto Dublin Bay. Plasterwork found in the entrance hall and oval room is in Adams Style which is typical of Dublin houses of this time period. Current use for the house is as a reception for important visitors to the campus. Outside the house is a Loblolly pine tree, the state tree of the state of Arkansas in America. It was presented to former US President Bill Clinton when he visited to open the Clinton Institute for American Studies in 2010. Beside the house is the walled gardens.",

But it's difficult to enjoy, with crowds jostling round the display case.
